> PGA -- Postgres Anywhere. The easiest way to install and run PostgreSQL.

The motivation behind *Postgres Anywhere* (PGA) is to enable engineers to start, host, and manage PostgreSQL with the best experience possible.

PGA offers a blazing-fast getting-started experience, enables you to have multiple major and minor versions of Postgres running at the same time, and manages your Postgres instances without compromising your existing system configuration.
