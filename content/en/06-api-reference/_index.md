description: The API reference of the PGA Daemon
---

This is the API reference of the PGA Daemon.

Besides the `pga` command line, it's possible to interact with the daemon via HTTP API, to manage the Postgres clusters and the PGA setup.
By default, the PGA daemon is available at `localhost:54321`.

See the [custom installation]({{% relref "/02-installation/01-custom-installation" %}}) for configuring the PGA daemon.
